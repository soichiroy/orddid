\description{
\code{gun_twowave} is a part of the replication data from Barney and Schaffner (2019).
The data set is constructed combining the two-wave panel from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) 2010-12 study 
 with the mass shooting data originally analyzed by Newman and Hartman (2019).
