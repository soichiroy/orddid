\description{
A subset of approximately 2000 individuals from the CCES 2010-12 panel,
augmented with IRT ideology scores and demographic variables.
The ideology scores are estimated via a two-parameter logistic (2PL) IRT model
fitted to CCES policy items.  This dataset is designed for demonstrating the
semiparametric estimator, which requires at least one continuous covariate.
