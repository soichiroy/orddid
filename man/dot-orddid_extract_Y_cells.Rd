\title{Extract outcome vectors by post/treat cells}
\usage{
.orddid_extract_Y_cells(data, outcome, post, treat, remove_na = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame-like object containing the variables}

\item{outcome}{Character scalar; column name for the outcome variable}

\item{post}{Character scalar; column name for the post-period indicator (logical)}

\item{treat}{Character scalar; column name for the treatment indicator (logical)}

\item{remove_na}{Logical; if TRUE (default), drop rows with NA in any of
outcome, post, or treat before subsetting}
}
\value{
A named list with elements `Y11`, `Y10`, `Y01`, and `Y00`, each a
  vector of the outcome in the corresponding cell.
}
\description{
Given a data frame and the column names for the outcome, post indicator, and
treatment indicator (all logical/boolean), this helper returns the four
vectors commonly used in DID with two periods and two groups:
- Y11: post & treated
- Y10: pre  & treated
- Y01: post & control
- Y00: pre  & control
}
\details{
This function performs only minimal handling of missing values (it removes
rows with missing outcome or missing indicators when `remove_na = TRUE`).
It assumes the inputs are already validated elsewhere (same convention as
other internal helpers in this package).
