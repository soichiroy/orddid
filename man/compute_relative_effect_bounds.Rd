\title{Compute sharp bounds on the relative treatment effect for ordinal outcomes}
\usage{
compute_relative_effect_bounds(p1, p0)
}
\arguments{
\item{p1}{A numeric vector of non‑negative probabilities giving the
marginal distribution of the treated potential outcome ``Y(1)``. Its
length ``J`` determines the number of ordinal categories (assumed to be
labelled 0, …, J − 1). The elements should sum to one.}

\item{p0}{A numeric vector of non‑negative probabilities giving the
marginal distribution of the control potential outcome ``Y(0)``. It must
be the same length as ``p1`` and should also sum to one.}
}
\value{
A list with components:

* `lower` – the sharp lower bound γ_L on the relative treatment effect.
* `upper` – the sharp upper bound γ_U on the relative treatment effect.

For binary outcomes (length of ``p1`` equal to 2), the bounds coincide with
the usual average treatment effect, i.e. the difference in means
``sum((0:(J-1)) * p1) - sum((0:(J-1)) * p0)``:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  If ``p1`` and
``p0`` contain only a single category, the relative treatment effect is
identically zero.
}
\description{
Given the marginal distributions of the potential outcomes under treatment
(``p1``) and control (``p0``), this function returns the sharp upper and
lower bounds on the relative treatment effect γ as derived by Lu et al.
(2020) in Equations (3) and (4):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
The bounds are expressed in closed form using auxiliary quantities δ⁠_j⁠m
and ξ⁠_j⁠m (Equations (2) and (5)) that depend only on the marginals
:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
